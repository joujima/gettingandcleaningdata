# Code Book
There are a set of variables that store measurements, identifications, and labels.

## Labeling and Identification Variables
Label variables were obtained from activity labels data set, and linket to the label code, which remained in the final dataset; the subject IDs were obtained from each sub data set (subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt), which related each observation to a specific volunteer.
- labelCode: codes related to activities from 1 to 6, with respective correspondence in variable labelName;
- subjectID: identification codes related to each volunteer;
- labelName: names related to activities among the categories WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING;

## Measurement Variables
There are also a subset of variables that comes from the original data set. From "features_info.txt", that belongs to the data set, and shows information about the variables on the feature vector:

*The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
"-XYZ" is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.*

*The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:*

- mean(): Mean value

- mad(): Median absolute deviation 
- max(): Largest value in array
- min(): Smallest value in array
- sma(): Signal magnitude area
- energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
- iqr(): Interquartile range 
- entropy(): Signal entropy
- arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
- correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
- maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
- meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
- skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
- kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
- bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
- angle(): Angle between to vectors.
